Running The Project:
---------------------
Update Config.php in the src/configs folder
1) Make sure BASE_URL is set to the directory containing index.php on the local host
2) Make sure DB_HOST, DB_USER, etc. are set to what is necessary for connecting to mysql

From the src/configs directory, run php createDB.php

From the directory containing composer.json, run composer install

The website URL is <BASE_URL>/index.php
